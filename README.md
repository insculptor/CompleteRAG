# ðŸš€ FinsightRAG: Enhancing Financial Understanding with AI

FinsightRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced pipeline designed to demystify financial terms and concepts by leveraging the extensive database of Investopedia. This project aims to provide users with precise and comprehensible explanations of financial terms through a process that summarizes, retrieves, reranks, augments, and generates responses. It serves as a comprehensive tool for individuals seeking clear insights into the complex world of finance.

>**NOTE:** CompleteRAG is currently a WIP. Stay tuned for updates and new features!


## Architecture Overview

CompleteRAG's architecture is designed to efficiently handle and respond to user queries by accessing a vast knowledge base of financial information. The architecture diagram below offers a visual representation of the system's workflow and component integration.

## Detailed Project Workflow

### 1. Project Setup

The setup process for CompleteRAG involves several critical steps to ensure the system's optimal functionality and scalability:

- **Cookiecutter Integration:**
    - Utilize the Data Science Project Template through Cookiecutter for structured project organization. [Template Repository](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)

- **Environment and Dependencies:**
    - Establish a Conda Virtual Environment (recommended version 3.11.7) and manage dependencies via `requirements.txt`. Modify this file as needed, particularly for setups without GPU access.

- **Configuration:**
    - Create a `.env` file locally to define essential environment variables and paths, ensuring seamless functionality.

- **Initial Repository Setup:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/insculptor/CompleteRAG.git
    ```

- **Component Configuration:**
    - Incorporate FAISS for efficient vector similarity searches and MongoDB for metadata management.

### 2. Data Acquisition and Preparation

For accurate and relevant financial explanations, CompleteRAG meticulously processes and organizes data from Investopedia and other financial documents:

- **Investopedia Data Crawling:**
    - Included in the project are a Jupyter Notebook and a Python script (`notebooks/scrape_investopedia.ipynb` & `scrape_investopedia.py`) designed for extracting Investopedia data, storing each term in individual PDFs for comprehensive analysis.

- **Incorporating Additional Financial Terms:**
    - Optionally, additional financial term PDFs can be added to enhance the dataset. It is advisable to divide larger documents into smaller, logically organized PDFs for improved management.

- **Data Cleaning:**
    - Clean the collected and added data to ensure it is free from irrelevant characters, spaces, or symbols introduced during the collection phase.

## Getting Started

Follow these setup instructions to begin working with CompleteRAG:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/insculptor/CompleteRAG.git
    ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
    - Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    - Confirm all environmental variables are accurately configured in the `.env` file.

3. **Data Preparation:**
    - Adhere to the guidelines in section 2 for preparing your financial data.

4. **Launch CompleteRAG:**
    - With the setup completed, you can now utilize CompleteRAG to navigate and understand financial terms effortlessly.
